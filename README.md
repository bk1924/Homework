**Two Sigma**

“Technology drives our business. We use machine learning, distributed computing and other technologies to find connections in the world’s data. We’ve been pushing the frontiers of Big Data since before it was a buzzword. To us, it’s just data. We work with vast sets of it, from over a thousand diverse sources.” #

**Introduction**
#
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2002 by three different financial analysts and mathematicians - David Siegal, John Overdeck and Mark Pickar. Unlike any other standard hedge funds, the purpose of its establishment was that the founders believed that innovative technology and data science may aid and reconfigure the value of world’s data. Through its use of algorithms and with its distinctive culture, Two Sigma drives technology transformation in various fields including investment management.

Prior to the establishment of Two Sigma, David Siegal and John Overdeck had extraordinary life paths in comparison to other hedge fund managers. David Siegal earned a doctorate in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and was Chief Information Officer at D.E. Shaw & Co. Similar to Siegal’s strong quantitative background, John Overdeck’s history is also full of mathematics. With an undergraduate degree from Stanford University, Overdeck ranked silver medalist at the International Mathematical Olympiad.Both partners’ common interests supported the foundation to form a successful data driven company. 

Behind the company name are two meanings- the lower case sigma, σ, indicating the volatility of returns in investment over a given period, and an upper case sigma, Σ, implying the summation of the total rate of return from its investment. The formation of the two symbols concatenate the volatility of individual’s positions measured against the benchmark. 

There are three subsidiaries under Two Sigma - Two Sigma Securities, Two Sigma Ventures and Sightway Capital. Two Sigma Securities was formed in 2009 to engage and focus on high-frequency trading. Throughout five different funding rounds, from series A to series D, Two Sigma Securities had raised a total of  $130 million from Lending Club, Zymergen, Ufora, Crux Informatics and Terray Theraputics. The goal for Two Sigma Ventures is to support start-up companies that have encountered challenges in cruel and arduous environments with the application of math, data, and advance computing. Two Sigma Ventures have raised a total of $409 million from 10 different organizations. Sightway Capital focuses on long-term investments and is a private equity fund in financial services and real assets.

**Business Activities**
#
Although composed by a blossom of business models, Two Sigma Investment was prominent for its algorithmic trading- the use of certain computer programs, Python, Java or C++ and languages, Pandas, Numpy or Scikit-learn, to buy and sell large amounts of orders in the market with electronic access. 

Most of the purchases, from stocks to bonds, made by traders were done by phone calls to designated market makers at the stock exchange. By 2014, the number of algorithmic traders surpassed the number of high touch orders through phone calls to DMAs. The major reason of proliferation of an automated trading is not only because such methods maximize individual’s return, but also because the algorithm enables programmers or traders to control execution costs and market risks.  

One type of a market risk is a slippage in security price. Two Sigma’s goal is to mitigate the risks and then execute large amounts of stock without affecting the underlying stock price. Often, the amounts are overwhelmingly immense that the market is unable to absorb without impacting the price. In order to minimize the impact, Two Sigma Investment splits into smaller orders which is executed electronically over the course of minutes, hours and days without impacting the stock price. To avoid any harm, the company considers three major key components when executing the stock- Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP), Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and the Percentage Of Volume (POV). To offset the market volatility, the company executes equal amounts of shares, during a benchmark, as spontaneous selling large amounts of stock to the market may cause appreciations or depreciations in price. 

In order to maximize returns without causing any damages to the market, the traders at Two Sigma carefully watch over the changes in the daily traded volume, then averages the price that commensurate the volume. This renowned procedure is called VWAP.  In each time-interval, the computer executes an amount proportional to the normative volume for that interval. To confirm the accuracy, the company either tries to generalize the prediction of its statistics or uses POV to track down actual traded volumes per day as benchmarking. The idea behind this latter method is to have a constant percentage of market participants along the trading period. It is also an attempt to execute orders during a steady market with approximately a similar number of traders . 

To this day, the company has seven funds with absolute-returns that can be summarized into two categories: equity-market neutral and various macro strategies. The Two Sigma fund launched in 2002 and was merely focused on market-neutral strategy. The strategy is a type of investment strategy that embarked upon a stock trader that seeks to profit from both increasing and decreasing prices in one or more markets while avoiding some specific form of market risk. 

The fund had performed well until 2007, especially it notched double digits in the first year as well as during dotcom bubble burst. The first fund took firm advantage over affluent available data and liquid market. John Overdeck had confident that data is major key to success and discovered that using one specific platform to the fund, which will eventually expand to other market. With high turnover strategy, holding stocks for few hours or days, the fund was well-performed not only in the US, but also Two Sigma fund implemented its strategy and model to European and Asian stocks, futures, and foreign exchange. 

The high turnover strategy often known as high-frequency trading and price forecasting. The definition of high-frequency trading is a program trading platform that uses computers to engage numerous orders in a second. It uses complex algorithms and machine learning to analyze several markets and to execute base on the market conditions. Such strategy has a greater advantage over other norm equity traders, for instance, the trader with higher speed rate of execution has better and higher profit than the other. Therefore, quantitative equity traders at Two Sigma  place number of the orders of approximately 300 million shares per day. 

There are many advantages of using computer programming for the purpose of algorithmic trading. However, the art and beauty of Two Sigma fund is a capability of generating accurate price forecasting through machine learning. The company gathers all the available data from Bloomberg or capital IQ and categorize the data into feature and target variables. Then with machine learning process, the fund generates either linear or logistic regression with an extracted data that may fit to the trained and test observations, classifies the data with classification, kNN or Decision Tree, predicts and tests the accuracy score of the prediction. These procedures may take large sum of time away from the programmer, but it is tedious but essential procedure to produce the smallest error possible. 

To give an example, to predict and analyze the stock price, the traders use statistics as an underlying method. More specifically, the most fundamental concept of machine learning would be Hacker statistics. Hacker statistics demands statistical inference, which means taking individual's data to probabilistic conclusions about what you expect if you took even more data, and the individuals makes decision on these conclusions. Furthermore, instead of using repeated data, Hacker statistics use simulated repeated measurements to compute probabilities. 

Assembling these complex methods of statistics for price prediction, Two Sigma fund decided to expand its business. In 2004, Two Sigma fund expanded its asset class by launching another two funds - Eclipse and Spectrum. The trading strategy for the former is the fund included futures and foreign exchange into the existed macro strategy, where the latter was designed for a longer holding period of securities and cleared a pathway to a more scalable asset management business. And in 2011, Two Sigma launched Absolute return, which had a longer holding period.

With varieties of its trading strategy, Two Sigma has also evolved in various ways. During first seven years after the debut, Two Sigma managed money for traditional hedge fund investor, wealthy individuals, family offices and fund investors. After going through 2007-2010 financial recession, however, the fund has changed the type of the investor from traditional hedge fund clients to institutional investors, including pensions, endowments, and sovereign wealth fund on the same platform.

**Landscape**
#
Several competitors and alternatives could be observed on the surface of the industry if we consider the Two Sigma Fund solely as a financial service firm. However, since the company is more interconnected with technology than finance, such as FinTech, there are only a handful of companies, such as Tower Research Capital and Citadel Investment Group LLC, that would be able to compete against the Absolute Return fund from Two Sigma.

In 1998, Mark Gorton and John Martello founded Tower Research Capital- a proprietary trading company that also assigns along FinTech. The company also builds and analyzes the market much like the Two Sigma Fund. Tower Research Capital trades and develops sophisticated hedging tools to imply and manage its gigantic portfolio. Tower Research has expanded its model and specializes in quantitative trading and investment strategies, detecting non-random patterns in the stock market by using statistical methodology. Exploiting these inefficiencies allows the firm to earn exceptional gains while mitigating risks. The order execution is done with an automated trade execution infrastructure. 

Citadel Investment Group LLC is also a financial institution with an outstanding quantitative strategy division. Founded in 1990, by Kenneth C. Griffin, the company perhaps would be categorized into two. The first entity is simply known as Citadel, with immense sizes of its asset under management, close to $25 billion as of 2018, and focuses on alternative asset investment. Another entity, Citadel Securities, is perhaps one of Two Sigma’s strongest competitors. Citadel Securities is a part of the leading market makers in not only the US but worldwide and concentrates in trading equities, equity options, and interest rate swaps for institutional and retail clients. Until 2016, its flagship fund has delivered annualized rates of return of 16 percent and 19 percent over 20-plus years.

The three companies mentioned above have devoted inexplicable amounts of effort and have enlightened the field of finance. Before computer science or data analytics took presence, the majority of the analysts on Wall Street, for example, had used fundamental analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, EBITDA multiples or top-down analysis. Therefore, the analysts were required to obtain separate financial statements from the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission website or other resources- for example, the Bloomberg terminal. Often, the analysts or the companies that used provided services had to pay a large sum of service fees to the providers. 

As of 2014, the company has started to adopt an advanced technology through computer and data science. The analysts are now in a position to extract multiple information from websites by simply indicating a source of data set as ‘Yahoo’ or ‘Morningstar’. Since the data analysts are capable of handling and manipulating mega data within a short amount time, an efficiency of the work environment and performance by individuals have enhanced, which gives justification to higher performance for the companies mentioned above.

**Recommendation and Result**
#
To measure a degree of each company’s succession, comparing historical performance would be superb and convenient rather than scrutinize over massive portfolios. For the years between 2009 and 2014, net annualized returns are above 30 percent, mostly low 30s, Sharpe ratio is between 1 and 1.5, max drawdown is less than 20 percent but double-digit. Where Citadel’s flagship multi-strategy Wellington Fund has delivered annualized returns, after complex fee, of 19.1 percent since its birth in 1990. 

Due to limited availability of public information regarding the firm’s performance, analyzing value of its portfolio of equity side of Tower Research would be an optimal valuation method to evaluate the result of the investment outcome. The portfolio value from 2014 to 2019 has increased from $400 million to $1.6 billion. However, throughout a period of recovery after the recession, most of quantitative funds had experienced abrupt capital outflows due to unanticipated event. 

There are two major problems in terms of following up with the market trend for Two Sigma and the other algorithmic trading firms. In December 2018, stock markets had experienced sudden rout of capital due to geopolitical dispute between China and the U.S. During this timeline, the fund investors learned in most brutal way that when data-based computers invest $220 billion based on historical price trends did worse than most other managers, robot or human. The perception from the investors for algorithmic trading became frigid because the quants are rather considered pristine and underdeveloped due to limitation of human brain. Often, the traders struggle to react fast enough to the unpredicted events. For example, 200 words of president Trump's tweet could result the trend line of stock markets to the south. 

Another problem is too much money chases the same trends, undermining what traders call alpha, which measures outperformance possible relative to benchmark. If all algorithmic traders attempt to pursue same strategy, such as identifying two shoulders and heads and then buying when a stock hits one of the shoulders, then the demand side of the market will be ramped up that dilutes targeted average price of the stock. 
In order for Two Sigma or any other trading firms to prevent abrupt capital outflow, the firm needs to establish more of unique trading strategies rather than depends on trend follow strategy. For example, Fibonacci retracement could be a possible solution because it creates by taking two extreme data set on a stock chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100% respectively. Therefore, in the for loop, set up an alarm signal once a stock reaches the desirable level from three to five ticks of the range, and encodes to engage a buy or sell orders. Hence, Two Sigma does not need to follow any market trends. 

Consequently, there are pros and cons regarding trading firms in terms of their strategies and performance. However, since Two Sigma is not only initiating in tradings, but also incubating and providing usable data set to early-stage companies; therefore, the company uses the researches on various industries to support and seek opportunity in different field. Also, Two Sigma might able to play as strategic investor in some cases through its long-term fund. Such expansion would eventually add value and will result positive reputation not only in finance industry, but also in technology as well as FinTech industry.
